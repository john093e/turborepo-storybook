# Turbo Storybook - issue reproduction

This is a reproduction of personal project based on the [Microfrontends](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/microfrontends) template from Vercel

1- To run it please duplicate the content of this git
```bash
git clone https://github.com/john093e/turborepo-storybook.git
```

2- Enter the folder
```bash
cd turborepo-storybook
```

3- Run the install of packages
```bash
pnpm install
```

4- Once install run the dev environement : 
```bash
turbo run dev
```
it will open storybook in your browser


## The issue : 
Components placed in storybook package show the full args list ( instorybook, instorybookwithtailwind )
Components placed in design-system package show only a part of the args list. ( designsystem, designsystemwithtailwind )

## Expected comportment : 
Components in design-system should also show all args in storybook autogenerated docs.

## Thank you : 
Many thanks to any one taking the time to help on this.
